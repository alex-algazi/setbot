# Discord SET Bot
This is the repository for our Discord bot, which facilitates a multiplayer game of "SET".

This project is made possible by [discord.js](https://discord.js.org), a Node.js framework for the Discord API.

## How to play
First, invite the bot to your server using [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=917630979659685908&permissions=8192&scope=applications.commands%20bot). Then, start a game using the "/newgame" command, and cards will be dealt onto the "board" for all players to see. The goal of the game is to find "sets", or groups of three cards where each property is **either the same for all three cards or different for all three cards**. Here are some examples of sets:
